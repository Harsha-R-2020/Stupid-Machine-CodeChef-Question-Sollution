# Stupid-Machine-CodeChef-Question-Sollution
As  usual,  I  went  to  work  in  the  morning.  Unfortunately,  I  found  out  that  my  manager  bought  a  new machine and I have to learn to operate it. There  are NN boxes  in  a  line  (numbered 11 through NN).  Initially,  the  boxes  are  empty,  and  I  need  to  use  the  machine  to  put  tokens  in  them.  For  each  valid ii,  the ii-th  box  has  a  maximum  capacity SiSi tokens.  I  can  perform  the  following  operation  any  number  of  times:  choose  an  integer LL (1≤L≤N1≤L≤N) and put one token in each of the boxes 1,2,...,L1,2,...,L. My manager told me to put as many tokens as possible into the boxes in total (the distribution of  tokens  in  the  boxes  does  not  matter).  Of  course,  it  is  not  allowed  to  perform  an  operation  that  would  result  in  the  number  of  tokens  in  some  box  exceeding  its  capacity.  Can  you  help  me  calculate the maximum number of tokens that can be put in these boxes?
